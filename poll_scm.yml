Poll SCM / Source Code Polling


So poll scm means, whenever developer are pushing the code to the remote repository, then jenkins will start the job automatically..


-	Now for the demonstration purpose of poll scm or source code polling scm operation  i have code is available in the github repository.. so I have created the repository called  
jenkinsprojectrepository

-	And added below files inside that repository
1)	app.js  content  console.log("Hello, From Jenkins!");
2)	package.json  content 
{
  "name": "jenkins-sample",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  }
}


3)	README.md  the content is 

# Jenkins Polling SCM Sample Project

This is a simple Node.js app for Jenkins SCM polling demo.

Note  These files I have created on the remote repository..


Configurations 

-	Created new project called  pollscmjob
-	Under configure   selected source code management operation  and selected git
-	Inside repository url  mentioned my repositories url  then branches to build option I used  default */master (this branch is present in the repository)
-	Under the build trigger option  select poll scm  I have scheduled a job will run after modification of code then it will trigger within 5 minutes  and I have mentioned cron 
        expression as below
-	H/5 * * * *
-	Then just save and apply the changes..
-	Now do the changes in your app.js file  this will start your job automatically within a 5 minutes after changing the code..

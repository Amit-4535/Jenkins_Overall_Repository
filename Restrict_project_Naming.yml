Restrict Project Naming



🔐 What Is “Restrict Project Naming” in Jenkins?
The Restrict project naming option is used to enforce a naming convention for all new jobs/projects created in Jenkins.
When enabled, it uses a regular expression (regex) to define what names are allowed. If someone tries to create a project/job with a name that doesn’t match the regex, Jenkins will block it.


🧭 Where to Find This Option:
1.	Go to Jenkins Dashboard.
2.	Click on Manage Jenkins.
3.	Click Configure System.
4.	Scroll to "Restrict project naming".
5.	Enable the checkbox.
6.	You’ll see a field to enter a Regular Expression and Description.



🧪 How It Works:
Field	                Description
Name pattern (regex)	This is the pattern Jenkins uses to validate job names.
Description	        (Optional) A message explaining the naming rules to users trying to create jobs.


✅ Why Use It:
•	Standardize naming (e.g., for folder automation or reporting).
•	Avoid invalid or problematic job names.
•	Security & organization in shared Jenkins environments.


📌 Example Scenario:
If you manage a Jenkins instance for multiple teams and want each team’s jobs to start with their team name (e.g., teamA-build, teamB-deploy), you could use:
^team(A|B|C)-.*


example --

suppose i want to create every job which is started from the dev name then my expression should be --
^dev.*$     (no space in this expression)

i want to start every job with test name then the expression should be as below
^test.*$      (no space allowd)


like wise you can create the restrict project naming here in the jenkins..


note -- if you tried to give the another name except than the pattern -- then this will give you the error, or it will not allowd you to create the job with another name..

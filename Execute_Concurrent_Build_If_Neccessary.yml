Execute concurrent builds if necessary


The main purpose of this concept is we can decide how many jobs can be run on a single node at a time..
This setting is for only freestyle job and not applied for the pipeline jobs..
( This is a setting in Jenkins Freestyle Jobs (not pipelines) that allows multiple builds of the same job to run in parallel — instead of queuing up one by one.)

When this option is checked, multiple builds of this project may be executed in parallel.


This multiple builds will be running on single node or also the multiple nodes..
depending on the scenarios..... If one agent is free  then multiple builds can run on single node.... If multiple agent is free  then also multiple builds can run on multiple nodes.


Where to Find It:
•	Go to Job Configuration
•	Check the option:
✅ “Execute concurrent builds if necessary”



By Default:
Jenkins does NOT allow concurrent builds of the same job.
If a job is running and triggered again, the new build waits in the queue until the previous one finishes.


What Happens When This Option is Enabled?
•	Jenkins will allow the same job to run multiple builds at the same time.
•	Useful when builds are independent of each other and don't interfere (e.g., running tests for different branches or environments).



Example Scenario
Let’s say your job is named Run-Tests and it’s configured to build when:
•	Code is pushed to GitHub
•	A manual trigger is run


Without Concurrent Builds:
[Build #101] started
[Build #102] triggered but queued
[Build #103] triggered but queued
#102 runs only after #101 finishes


With "Execute Concurrent Builds if Necessary":
[Build #101] started
[Build #102] started immediately (in parallel)
[Build #103] started immediately (in parallel)


When NOT to Use It
You should NOT enable this when:
•	The job accesses shared resources (e.g., same file, DB, environment).
•	The builds conflict (e.g., overwriting the same files or folders).
•	The job was not designed to be thread-safe.


When to Use It
You should enable this if:
•	The job is stateless or isolated.
•	Jobs are working on different Git branches or test environments.
•	You want to speed up build processing and avoid queue delays.


for demo purpose the project are as below.

first job.
enable the option -- concurrent build if neccessary
and add the below script in the execute shell command.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Running test for build $BUILD_NUMBER"
sleep 30
echo "Build $BUILD_NUMBER completed"


now build this job -- this will take the longer time


meanwhie create the another job 
and mention the execute shell and can add the below script
echo "the example of the concurrent build job"
echo "the build is running very smootly" > concurent.txt


what happen -- you can see both the jobs can run parallally at a single time.. this is the use case of the concurrent build if neccessary

 View in Jenkins  list view/my view / delivery pipeline view / and build pipeline view

 Views in Jenkins help you organize and group jobs together, so you don’t have to see all jobs on a single cluttered dashboard.


 There are different types of views depending on your goals:
•	Simple List View
•	My Views
•	Build Pipeline View
•	Delivery Pipeline View
•	Nested Views (folders)
•	Dashboard View (with plugins)




🎯 Why Use Views?
✅ For teams or large Jenkins instances:
•	Separate projects by team or function (e.g., Dev, QA, Infra)


1. ✅ List View (Default & Custom)   this is the default view.  Default Jenkins view shows all jobs

Configurations 

- first go to the my view
-	Then you will see that + icon is there
-	Enter view name
-	3 types are there  include global view / list view and / my view is there
-	This lab I am using name as myview  then select the option as list view and then  create the view..
-	Here you can add the description
-	Select your jobs here
-	Save and apply..



Demo lab 2  creating pipeline view (this option is basically for the pipeline projects not for the freestyle projects.)

-	First install the plugin build pipeline view  go to manage Jenkins  manage plugin  available section and search for  pipeline view (plugin)  install it..
-	if you create the pipeline job and added the different steps in it, then you will be able to see the different stages through the view.



Demo 3  delivery pipeline view (this is baasically for the upstream and the downstream projects -- to check the stage views)

-	Install delivery pipeline plugin first
-	Make sure that your all the jobs are available like build-job, test-job and the deploy-job
-	Now create delivery pipeline view now  click on + button  select delivery pipeline view  name to that view  select okay and now do the configurations  choose component specifications choose job and  add your build job  set max number of builds: 5  save the configurations..
-	Now click on Click the Trigger (play) button next to build-job
-	You will see the pipeline stages here..

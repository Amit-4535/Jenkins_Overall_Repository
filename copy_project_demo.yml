Copy_Project_Demo


copy project basically we are doing for -- copying the existing project into our new project..

🔁 What is the "Copy existing project" option?
This feature allows you to create a new Jenkins job by cloning an existing one. It copies:
✅ Job configuration
✅ Build triggers
✅ Build steps
✅ Post-build actions


this is very useful when -- you want to reuse the same logic for similar projects (e.g., same build steps with a different repo or branch).


job configurations --

- select new item
- name to the project like copy_project
- and on bottom of the page we have option -- copy from -- so select job name, from which you want to copy the project.
- click okay


- now when you are opening this job -- you can see that whatever configuration we have did in the past/previous projects that all are come here.

  this project will bring exact below values..
  ✅ Job configuration
  ✅ Build triggers
  ✅ Build steps
  ✅ Post-build actions

System Message


✅ Why Do We Use the System Message in Jenkins?

The System Message in Jenkins is used to display an announcement or notice on the Jenkins dashboard — right at the top. This is helpful for communicating important information to all users who log in.

📌 Common Use Cases for System Message:
🔔 Purpose              	📝 Example
🛠️ Maintenance Notice	        “Jenkins will be down for maintenance from 10 PM to 12 AM.”
🚫 Build Restrictions	        “Do not trigger builds between 2 PM – 3 PM due to DB migration.”
⚠️ Known Issues	                “New builds are failing due to network issues. Team is investigating.”
📢 Upgrade Info	                “Jenkins upgraded to version 2.440. Please report any issues.”
👥 Usage Guidelines	        “Do not run Docker-in-Docker jobs unless approved by DevOps team.”


🔧 How to Set It?
1.	From Jenkins Dashboard:
o	Go to: Manage Jenkins → Configure System
o	Scroll to System Message
o	Enter your message (supports basic HTML for formatting)
o	Save


🧠 Why It Matters?
•	Ensures clear communication with all Jenkins users.
•	Prevents accidental usage during downtime.
•	Acts as a dashboard bulletin board for the CI/CD team.

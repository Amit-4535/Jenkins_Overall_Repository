Number of Executor


✅ What Is “Number of Executors” in Jenkins?
The "Number of Executors" in Jenkins refers to how many jobs can run in parallel at a time on a given node (master or agent) — including the Jenkins controller node.


📌 Where You See This Setting:
•	Go to Manage Jenkins → system → # of executors: [ 2 ]    save and apply..


💡 Example:
If a node has:
Number of Executors = 2
➡️ That means this node can run 2 Jenkins jobs at the same time.
If 3 jobs are triggered at once:
•	2 will run immediately (in parallel),
•	1 will stay in the queue until one executor becomes free.


🧠 Why Executors Are Important?
🔍 Purpose	          ✅ Benefit
Enable parallel builds	  Faster CI/CD pipelines
Optimize resource usage	  Better CPU/RAM utilization
Prevent overload	  Avoids running too many heavy jobs on one machine


⚠️ Important Notes:
•	Setting too many executors can overload the machine (especially the controller).
•	On Jenkins controller, it is recommended to keep executors = 0, and run jobs on agents.


•	🧠 Best Practice Recommendations:
Node Type               	Recommended Executors
Jenkins Controller	        0 or 1 (if you must)
Jenkins Agent (4 CPU cores)	2 to 4
Jenkins Agent (8 CPU cores)	4 to 6

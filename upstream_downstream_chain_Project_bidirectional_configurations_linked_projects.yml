Upstream Jobs / downstream jobs/ chain job / linked jobs  (bidirectional configurations) 


Here we are creating 3 jobs named as
1)	Build-job
2)	Test-job and
3)	Deploy-job


Now 1st build-job configuration is as follows  click new item  enter name as build-job  freestyle job  and okay  Scroll to Build → Add build step → Execute shell, then add:  and add command  echo "🛠️ Building the project..."
Scroll to Post-build Actions → Add post-build action → Build other projects  In Projects to build, enter: test-job and then save the configurations..


Now 2nd  job configurations  Click New Item → Enter test-job → Choose Freestyle project → Click OK.  Under Build → Execute shell, add:  echo "🧪 Running tests on the project..."  enter command  echo "🧪 Running tests on the project..."  Add Post-build Action → Build other projects, and enter: deploy-job and save..


Now 3rd job configurations  Click New Item → Enter deploy-job → Choose Freestyle project → Click OK.  Under Build → Execute shell, add:  echo "🚀 Deploying the project..."  and save..


Now  Go to build-job → Click Build Now  
✔️ build-job will run
✔️ then test-job will be triggered
✔️ then deploy-job will run


This is how we are setting up the upstream jobs inside the Jenkins…


Downstream jobs 

🎯 Where is "Projects to Watch" used in Jenkins?
➡️ It's part of the Build Triggers section, specifically when you configure a downstream job to get triggered after another job completes.


🧩 It appears in:
🛠 Freestyle Projects → Configure → Build Triggers → Build after other projects are built


🧠 What does "Projects to Watch" mean?
It tells Jenkins:
"Only trigger this job if these specific upstream jobs run and complete."
You specify the name(s) of the upstream jobs here.


Lab for upstream and downstream jobs 

Now we have 3 jobs 
Build-job
Test-job and
Deploy-job


🔧 Step 1: build-job – Set only Downstream
1.	Go to Jenkins dashboard → build-job → Configure
2.	Scroll to Post-build Actions
3.	Click Add post-build action → Build other projects
4.	Enter:  test-job name here

This sets test-job as downstream of build-job


🔧 Step 2: test-job – Set Both Upstream and Downstream
1.	Go to test-job → Configure
2.	Scroll to Build Triggers
3.	✅ Check "Build after other projects are built"
4.	In Projects to watch, enter: build-job here
5.	Scroll to Post-build Actions → Add post-build action → Build other projects
6.	Enter : deploy-job

✅ This makes test-job:
•	Downstream of build-job
•	Upstream of deploy-job
Click Save


🔧 Step 3: deploy-job – Set only Upstream
1.	Go to deploy-job → Configure
2.	Scroll to Build Triggers
3.	✅ Check "Build after other projects are built"
4.	In Projects to watch, enter: test-job here
5.	This makes deploy-job a downstream job of test-job
6.	Click Save



🧪 Final Test: Trigger the Whole Chain
1.	Go to build-job → Build Now
2.	What will happen:
o	build-job finishes → triggers test-job
o	test-job recognizes build-job as upstream, runs
o	test-job finishes → triggers deploy-job
o	deploy-job recognizes test-job as upstream, runs
🔁 All jobs are now linked forward and backward, and Jenkins clearly understands the dependency flow.



🔄 What is Bi-directional Configuration in Jenkins?
Bi-directional configuration means:
Setting both upstream and downstream relationships explicitly, in each job involved in a Jenkins pipeline.
In simple terms:
•	The upstream job knows who comes after it (via Post-build actions → Build other projects).
•	The downstream job knows who comes before it (via Build triggers → Build after other projects are built).

Note  in simple term it is the configuration of both the upstream and downstream job projects..

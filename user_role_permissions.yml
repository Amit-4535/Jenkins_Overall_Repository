User_Role_and_Permission



This is essential for enterprise setups, where you must control who can do what in Jenkins.


🧩 Jenkins Security Model Overview
Component	Description
Users	        Individual accounts for developers, admins, etc.
Roles	        Logical permission sets like Admin, Dev, Viewer, etc.
Groups	        Collections of users (useful in LDAP/SAML setups)
Permissions	Fine-grained access control on jobs, views, nodes, etc.


🧩 Step 2: Install the Role-Based Strategy Plugin
•  Go to: Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins
•  Click Available → Search for: - Role-based Authorization Strategy
✅ Install and Restart Jenkins



✅ Step : Enable Jenkins Security
1.	Go to: Manage Jenkins → Configure Global Security
2.	✅ Enable: Jenkins own user database
3.	Check: Allow users to sign up (optional for testing)
4.	Under Authorization, select:
🟢 Role-Based Strategy
5.	Click Save


👤 Step : Create Users
1.	Go to: Manage Jenkins → Manage Users
2.	Click Create User
3.	Provide:
o	Username
o	Password
o	Full name
o	Email
4.	Click Create User



🧱 Step 4: Configure Roles & Permissions
Go to: Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles → Manage Roles
Define Role Types:
•	Global roles: apply Jenkins-wide
•	Project roles: apply to specific jobs
•	Agent roles: for build nodes
Example Roles:
Role Name	  Permissions
admin	All (✅   All checkboxes)
developer	  Job create/build/configure, View builds
viewer	          Only Job read/build view
qa	          Build only jobs in QA folder


✅ To Add a Role:
1.	Under Global Roles, in Role to add box, type: developer
2.	Click Add
3.	✅ Grant permissions like:
o	Overall → Read
o	Job → Build, Job → Read, Job → Configure (optional)
4.	Repeat for viewer, admin, etc.



👥 Step 5: Assign Roles to Users
Go to: Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles → Assign Roles
For Global Roles:
Username	admin	developer	viewer
admin	        ✅
dev1		          ✅
qa1			                  ✅
Save the configuration.



📂 Step 6: Use Project-Based Roles (Optional but Powerful)
1.	Go back to Manage Roles
2.	Scroll to Project roles
3.	Add roles like qa-job or dev-job
o	Regex pattern: ^QA-.* or ^Dev-.*
o	Give Job → Build and Job → Read
Now:
•	Any job named QA-LoginTest, etc. is accessible only by qa1



🔒 Permission Types (Key Examples)
Permission Area	Common Permissions
Overall	Read, Administer
Job	Create, Build, Configure, Delete, Read
View	Read
Run	Replay, Update
Agent	Connect, Disconnect



✅ Real-Time Use Case Example
User	Role	        Access Example
admin	Admin	        Full access
dev1	Developer	Can create/edit only dev jobs
qa1	QA Tester	Can only trigger builds in QA jobs
viewer	Viewer	        Read-only access to all jobs


✅ Summary
What You Learned	Details
🔐 User creation	Jenkins built-in user management
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Role strategy	Global, Project, Agent roles
🎯 Permissions	Fine-grained control (build, config, view)
📂 Job-specific access	Use regex/project roles
🏢 Real-time application	Perfect for Dev, QA, Admin split



🔍 1. What Are Global Roles?
✅ Definition:
Global roles apply Jenkins-wide. They define what a user can do across the entire Jenkins system — regardless of which job, folder, or agent they are using.
📌 Examples of Global Permissions:
•	Overall → Administer (full Jenkins control)
•	Overall → Read (see Jenkins dashboard)
•	Job → Create (create new jobs globally)
•	View → Read (view Jenkins UI)


🔍 2. What Are Item Roles (Project Roles)?
✅ Definition:
Item roles are specific to jobs/folders/items. They control access to particular jobs, based on a name or pattern (regex).
📌 Examples of Item Permissions:
•	Job → Read
•	Job → Build
•	Job → Configure
•	Job → Delete



🔄 Key Difference Summary
Feature	Global Role	Item/Project Role
📍 Scope	Entire Jenkins	Specific jobs/folders only
⚙️ Purpose	High-level system permissions	Granular control of job access
🔑 Controls	System-level actions, job creation	Build, configure, delete per job
📌 Use Case	Admins, system-wide developers	Dev/QA teams with access to some jobs
🧠 Example	admin, developer, viewer	qa-job, dev-job, test-only

Scheduling Projects


🔄 What is the Schedule Project option in Jenkins?
The Schedule Project option lets you automate when your Jenkins jobs run by defining a schedule (cron-style) so jobs trigger periodically or at specific times — without manual intervention.


Why use Schedule Project?
•	To run builds/tests regularly (e.g., nightly builds)
•	To trigger deployments at off-hours (e.g., weekends or midnight)
•	To poll SCM (Source Control Management) periodically for changes
•	To automate repetitive tasks (backups, reports, etc.)

You can schedule the project or your job as per the cron expression 


Cron Syntax format (5 fields):
MIN HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
Field	Allowed Values	Meaning
MIN	0-59	Minute
HOUR	0-23	Hour (24-hour clock)
DOM	1-31	Day of month
MONTH	1-12 or JAN-DEC	Month
DOW	0-7 or SUN-SAT (0 and 7 are Sunday)	Day of week


Examples:
Schedule Expression	Meaning
H/15 * * * *	Every 15 minutes
0 2 * * *	Every day at 2:00 AM
0 0 * * 0	Every Sunday at midnight
0 0 1 * *	At midnight on the 1st of every month
@midnight	At midnight every day (shorthand)


Note for this demonstration purpose I am doing some changes in my build or in project that are inside the  execute shell I am defining below things 
echo "hello !!! this is my first jenkins job"
whoami
id
echo "This file was created during build number $BUILD_NUMBER at $(date)" > index.html



now let us do the configuration 

-	Go to your project
-	Go to the configure
-	Come to the build trigger option
-	Assign the cron schedule time  H/5 * * * * (I am running this job for every 5 minutes)
-	Click save and apply now.. wait for 5 minutes.. 14.48 it the current time now  you will see the next build at 14:53  yes now the build is executed..

this is how we are scheduling the project..
